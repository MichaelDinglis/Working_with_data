  # In order to get started, you have to install a few libraries. 
  
  * If you are using an IDE, click the "terminal" buttton and write (For debiam)"sudo apt-get install python3" and then "sudo apt-get install python3-pip"
  * To install the libraries, hit "pip3 install numpy", "pip3 install pandas", "pip3 install matplotlib", "pip3 install sklearn".
  
  * When working with data, it is preferred to use Jupyter notebooks. You can run "python -m pip install jupyter" or "python -m pip3 install jupyter" for windows. If it doesn't work, try installing conda as a Virtual Enviroment and work with that :)
  * For debian, [Click Here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-jupyter-notebook-with-python-3-on-ubuntu-18-04) for an easy tutorial
  
  * If you are having trouble installing it, you can start [working online here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/jupyterlab/jupyterlab-demo/master?urlpath=lab/tree/demo) 
  * In order to install the libraries in jupyter type "!pip3 install pandas" in a cell and run it. Do this for every library you need, and you are good to go!
